Implementing and Visualizing Maternal Mortality Rates
======
In my final year of undergraduate studies, one of the last requirements for my program was to choose a project that demonstrated the wide range of skills learned during my time at Truman State University. I wanted this project to demonstrate both the data science skills and computer science skills I possess, but I also desired a project I could be passionate about. These desires resulted in the idea for the maternal mortality rates project. This was a subject area that I always felt should be easier to access information on, fueling my interest in completing the project, while also having a level of technical difficulty that would serve to sufficiently challenge my skills.
