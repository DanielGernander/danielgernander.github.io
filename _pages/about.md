Welcome to a page dedicated to showcasing my personal and professional experiences related to data science! I truly appreciate the time you are spending in getting to know me even just a little bit better. I hope everything on the website is very clear! Please, feel free to reach out if any more information about anything is desired; my contact information should be available on the left side of the webpage.

Please use the navigation tabs at the top of the page to see different pages that show and discuss my various experiences.

A little bit more about me...
======
Apart from the skills that the experiences listed in this website are meant to display, I also wanted to include a little blurb here about my personal life, for the curious. I grew up primarily in central Missouri, which my tremendously supportive family continues to call home. In my younger years, I developed a love of both reading and music, the former especially around the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and the latter on learning to play the cello and the piano. During undergraduate studies at Truman State University in Kirksville, MO, I met my now wife, who originated from the Colorado Springs area, which eventually led to the recent relocation to the area. In my education, I followed a passion for data science, particularly for data visualization and database management, along with learning to enjoy the puzzle-solving aspects of computer programming; this path led to acheiving a Bachelor of Science in Statistics with a minor in Computer Science. Apart from education, I was lucky enough to have been given opportunities in wonderful workplaces where coworkers turned into great friends (but more information on that belongs to my resume). Currently, I look forward to continuing to work enthusiasticaly wherever the road may take me.
